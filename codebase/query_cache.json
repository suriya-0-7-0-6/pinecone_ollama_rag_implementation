It is written 生き甲斐 (life + worthwhile) and is thought to lie deep within each person, guiding their actions and giving satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to life. [2] [3]",

It literally combines the characters for “life” (生き) and “worthwhile” (甲斐), meaning a life that is worthwhile and meaningful [1], [3]. In Okinawan culture, discovering one’s ikigai is seen as key to long, happy living and continuous activity even beyond retirement [2]."
