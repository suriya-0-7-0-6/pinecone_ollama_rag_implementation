This is summarized in the five‑step model described in the Vienna clinic study [1].  \n\n2. **Finding one’s “ikigai”** – the Japanese concept of a reason to get out of bed. By confronting the existential void that appears when expectations don’t match personal desires, one can uncover this core purpose [2].  \n\n3. **Confronting existential crises** – asking the fundamental question “why do you not commit suicide?” forces patients to list meaningful reasons for living, thereby revealing their purpose. This method is a key element of logotherapy [3]."
