According to the book *Ikigai: The Art of Staying Young While Growing Old* by Héctor García and Francesc M. Iralles, everyone has an ikigai—what a French philosopher might call a *raison d’être*—though some people have discovered it while others are still searching, carrying it within themselves [1], [2].\n\nKey points from the text:\n\n| Aspect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Definition** | A hidden, personal reason for being that gives satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to life. It is what keeps people active and engaged even after retirement. |\n| **Origin** | The idea comes from Okinawa, an island known for its high concentration of centenarians. The locals view ikigai as the reason they get up each day and keep living with purpose. |\n| **Connection to longevity** | Those who discover and live by their ikigai tend to have a longer, more joyful life, contributing to the extraordinary longevity of Okinawans. |\n| **Practical implications** | A clear ikigai leads to activities that align with one's passions, values, and strengths, fostering resilience, community, and overall well‑being. |\n\nThus, *ikigai* is essentially the personal, enduring source of motivation and fulfillment that gives life meaning and encourages ongoing engagement and resilience.\n\n📊 **Answer Confidence:** 0.66"
